        <p>The ancient sanctuary of Olympian Zeus the Athenians say was built by Deucalion. Before the entrance to the sanctuary of Olympian Zeus – Hadrian the Roman emperor dedicated the temple and the statue, one worth seeing, which in size exceeds all other statues save the colossi at Rhodes and Rome, and is made of ivory and gold. (Pausanias, Book 1 Section6-9)</p>
        <p>The temple was constructed due to an interesting battle between Elis and Pisa, whoever won, was going to get the fundings to build this new temple, which would be sitting right outside the Olympic Stadium. It is a Hexastyle building made of limestone and  with  howed different the different metopes around its walls showed each one of the labors that Herakles did.</p>
        <p><strong>ZEUS was the Olympian king of the gods and the god of sky, weather, fate, law, justice and moral conduct..</strong></p>

        <p>It remains after this for me to describe the temple of Hera and the noteworthy objects contained in it. The Elean account says that it was the people of Scillus, one of the cities in Triphylia, who built the temple about eight years after Oxylus came to the throne of Elis. The style of the temple is Doric, and pillars stand all round it. (Pausanias, Description of Greece, 5.16)</p>
        <p>The Temple of Hera at Olympia is one of the oldest monumental temples in Greece, built around 600–580 BC. The temple was originally constructed with wooden columns, which were eventually replaced by stone. The temple was central to the worship of Hera, queen of the gods, and held important offerings, including the table for the Olympic victors' wreaths.</p>

        <p>Geraistos [in Euboia] . . . is conveniently situated for those who are sailing across from Asia to Attica since it is near Sounion. It has a sanctuary (hieron) of Poseidon, the most notable of those in that part of the world, and also a noteworthy settlement. (Strabo, Geography 10.1.7)</p>
        <p>The Temple of Poseidon was built around 444–440 BC, standing atop a dramatic cliff above the Aegean Sea. The view it had from the top of the cliff makes me think it was very helpful for sailors to use as a reference of the shore, similar to what a lighthouse does this day.  The temple is Doric, hexastyle, and 16 columns remain today.</p>

        <p>There was a sacred enclosure of the Eleusinian Demeter close by the side of both the armies; and it is said that the Melian women, when the Phocians were besieging the city, brought out the sacred things of the goddess and set them before the wall, and that the Phocians were struck with panic and fled.  (Herodotus, Histories 9.101)</p>
        <p>The Temple of Demeter at Sangri on Naxos is an early Ionic marble temple built around 530 BC. It stands on a hilltop amidst fertile fields, reflecting Demeter's role as goddess of agriculture. The temple was a center for rural festivals and worship specially with offers of pigs, grains and oxes, this makes sense since she was the goddess of agriculture and it could have been a way to thank her for the prosperous season. It is similar to what the Aztecs did when sacrificing humans so they could have rain and harvest correctly.</p>

        <p>As you enter the temple that they name the Parthenon, all the sculptures you see on what is called the pediment refer to the birth of Athena, those on the rear pediment represent the contest for the land between Athena and Poseidon. The statue itself is made of ivory and gold. On the middle of her helmet is placed a likeness of the Sphinx... The statue of Athena is upright, with a tunic reaching to the feet, and on her breast the head of Medusa is worked in ivory. (Pausanias, Description of Greece, 1.24.5-7)</p>
        <p>Similarly to Zeus' temple,an extraordinary statue of Athena, known as Athena Parthenos, which was sculpted by Phidias is thought to have stood about 12 meters high (39 feet). The parthenon also includes metopes like other temples which can symbolize how much they valued the telling of their own mythology. Ninety-two carved metopes depict Amazonomachy, a mythical battle between Amazon warriors and the ancient Greeks, and were thought to be designed by the sculptor Kalamis. This has a lot of similarity of how catholic churches depict the "Passion of Jesus" inside the walls of the churches.</p>

        <p>There was a temple of Apollo, wealthy and furnished with treasuries and votive offerings in abundance; and there was then, as there is even now, the seat of an Oracle there: this temple they plundered and burnt (Histories 8.33)</p>
        <p>The Temple of Apollo at Delphi was the spiritual and intellectual center of the Greek world. The present ruins date to the 4th century BCE, but the sanctuary’s origins stretch back to mythic times, with earlier temples built of laurel, wax, and bronze. The Doric temple, with six columns at the front and fifteen along the sides, housed the cult statue of Apollo and the omphalos, the “navel of the world.” The Pythia, Apollo’s priestess, delivered oracles that shaped Greek history, while the temple’s treasuries overflowed with offerings from city-states and kings.</p>

        <p>On the Temple of Artemis, I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, ‘Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand. (Antipater Greek Anthology 9.58)</p>
        <p>The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was rebuilt several times. Ephesus fell under the rule of the Lydian Kings and became a thriving city where men and women enjoyed equal opportunities. Artemis was the goddess of the hunt, chastity, childbirth, wild animals and the wilderness. During emperor Theodosius reign, a lot of the temple was erased and its ruins used to build Christian churches. This has some similarities of how the Spanish destroyed some of the pyramids to build Catholic churches around mexico.</p>

        <p>After the statues of Harmodios and Aristogeiton comes a temple of Ares, and in the temple are two images of Aphrodite, one of white marble, and the other, the older, of wood. There are also wooden images of Athena and Enyo. The statue of Ares is the work of Alcamenes; but I could not discover who made those of Aphrodite and Enyo. (Pausanias, Description of Greece 1.8.4)</p>
        <p>This Temple has six columns across the front and is surrounded by a single row of columns on all sides consisting of 13 columns per side. It was built from Pentelic marble, the same used for the Parthenon. Before the temple was moved to Agora, is known to have been near Mt. Hymettos. When the Temple stood there it was dedicated to Athena Pallenis and Apollo. It was only after it was moved to Agora that it was dedicated to Ares....</p>

        <p>On the summit of the Acrocorinthus is a temple of Aphrodite. The images are Aphrodite armed, Helius, and Eros with a bow. The spring, which is behind the temple, they say was the gift of Asopus to Sisyphus. (Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.5.1)</p>
        <p>The temple’s cult combined aspects of love, war, and fertility, and its reputation gave rise to the proverb, “Not for every man is the voyage to Korinthos.” The sanctuary was destroyed after the Roman sack of Corinth in 146 BCE but rebuilt in the Roman period. Its remains were later incorporated into a Christian church. Today, only traces of the temple survive, but its mythic and literary legacy endures. Some controversy exists as to why Acrocorinth was cataloged as a “sin city” and if the temple of Aphrodite helped caused it since Aphrodite was a prominent goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality.</p>

        <p>Above the Kerameikos and the portico called the King's Portico is a temple of Hephaistos. I was not surprised that by it stands a statue of Athena, because I knew the story about Erikhthonios. (Pausanias, Description of Greece 1.14.6–7)</p>
        <p>Overlooking the Agora, it was dedicated to Hephaestus, god of fire and craftsmanship, and Athena Ergane, patroness of artisans. The Doric peripteral temple features a colonnade of six by thirteen columns and sculpted metopes depicting the Labors of Heracles and the deeds of Theseus. It is one of the best preserved temples in all of Athens and it was built around the same time as the parthenon. As a fun fact, The temple was converted into the church of St George around the 7th century. In the 19th century, the church was used as a burial place for Protestants and for many European philhellenes who died in the Greek War of Independence in 1821.</p>

        <p>There is a mountain in Arcadia called Cyllene, and on it is a temple of Hermes, and they say that Hermes was born there. (Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.17)</p>
        <p>The Temple of Hermes on Mt. Cyllene in Arcadia is known mainly from literary sources, with no visible remains surviving today. According to myth, Hermes was born in a cave on this mountain, and the sanctuary was a site of rural worship and pilgrimage. Pausanias records that the temple stood on the mountain’s slopes and that the cult of Hermes was ancient and deeply rooted in Arcadian tradition.</p>

        <p>The oldest sanctuary of Dionysus is near the theater. Within the precincts are two temples and two statues of Dionysus, the Eleuthereus (Deliverer) and the one Alcamenes made of ivory and gold. There are paintings here—Dionysus bringing Hephaestus up to heaven. ... Besides this picture there are also represented Pentheus and Lycurgus paying the penalty of their insolence to Dionysus, Ariadne asleep, Theseus putting out to sea, and Dionysus on his arrival to carry off Ariadne. (Pausanias, Description of Greece)</p>
        <p>The theatre was dedicated to Dionysus, the god of wine-making and ecstasy, whose festivals were the driving force behind the development of Greek theater. It featured a vast stone auditorium, marble thrones for priests and dignitaries, and a central orchestra for ritual and performance. Today, only 20 of these sections have survived. The inscriptions on some of the thrones reveal that they belonged to elected rulers, while the other seats were intended for citizens.</p>
